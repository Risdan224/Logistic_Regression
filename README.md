Using Logistic Regression to Predict Breast Cancer Type

Logistic regression is one of the machine learning algorithms used to create classification models. Logistic regression is a statistical model that is used to predict the probability of a categorical outcome. The outcome can have two possible values, such as “yes” or “no”, “spam” or “not spam”, or “cancer” or “no cancer”.

In this Project, I will demonstrate the use of logistic regression to predict the type of breast cancer based on certain parameters.

The data I used is the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset. This dataset is available in the Scikit-learn (Sklearn) library for learning purposes.
